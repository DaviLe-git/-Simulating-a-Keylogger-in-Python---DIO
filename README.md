# Educational Malware Analysis Project

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY**
> This project is created strictly for educational purposes in a controlled environment. 
> The malware simulations are for learning cybersecurity concepts only.
> **DO NOT USE** these scripts for malicious activities.

## Project Overview

This repository contains educational simulations of malware behavior, specifically Ransomware and Keylogger implementations, created as part of a cybersecurity course. The goal is to understand how these threats work in order to better defend against them.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the practical functioning of Ransomware and Keyloggers
- Identify how malware exploits vulnerabilities and human factors
- Program Python scripts simulating real attacks in controlled environments
- Develop strategies for malware defense and prevention
- Document experiments and build technical portfolio

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔐 Simulated Ransomware
- `ransomware_simulator.py` - Encryption/decryption simulation with ransom note
- `file_generator.py` - Creates test files for demonstration
- `test_files/` - Directory containing sample files for testing

### ⌨️ Simulated Keylogger
- `keylogger_simulator.py` - Captures keystrokes and saves to file
- `email_sender.py` - Simulates automated email reporting

### 🛡️ Defense Analysis
- `prevention_measures.md` - Comprehensive prevention strategies
- `detection_methods.md` - Detection and mitigation techniques
